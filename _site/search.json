While educational technology has increased accessibility and flexibility in uncertain times, there are potential consequences due to the inherent lack of social connection and physical activities in online learning. In this project, we aim to investigate this increasing prevalence of educational technology and their impact on the well-being of individuals within this evolving educational landscape."

    "text": "Question 1: Which age group is most heavily impacted?\nTo investigate which age group is most heavily affected by the transition to online learning, we compare the reported comfortability with online class, state of wellness, efficiency with time utilization, and perceived social connection across different age groups.\nIt is apparent that college-aged students (aged 18 to 22) report the greatest negative impact with their online learning experience. They reported a negative experience during COVID-19 learning at over double the proportion of the other two age groups, and are also much less likely to have a positive experience with online class. These students also reported more health issues, less efficient time utilization, and worse social connection.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to Colombian students, college-aged students remain more negatively impacted by the transition to online learning compared to students of different age groups. In particular, they have a lower median score regarding their comfortability with online class. While the median score for all age groups across the other 3 categories are comparable, college students are more likely to report a lower score for their health satisfaction and social connection, as well as higher stress with time management."
